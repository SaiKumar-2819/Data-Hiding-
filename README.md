Data-Hiding 🔒
📌 Overview
>> This project implements image-based encryption and decryption techniques to securely hide and retrieve information within an image. It 
   allows you to encrypt a given image into a new form and later decrypt it back to its original state.

📂 Files in the Repository
>> encryption.py – Python script to encrypt an image.
>> decryption.py – Python script to decrypt an image.
>> mypic.jpg – The original image used for encryption.
>> encryptedImage.png – The encrypted version of the original image.

🛠️ How It Works
Encryption Process:
>> Takes an input image (mypic.jpg).
>> Applies an encryption algorithm to modify pixel values.
>> Saves the encrypted image (encryptedImage.png).

Decryption Process:
>> Takes the encrypted image as input.
>> Reverses the encryption process.
>> Retrieves the original image.
